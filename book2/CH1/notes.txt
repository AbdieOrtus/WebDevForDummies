Html is made of tags. 
<tag> content</tag>

The first tag is a start tag and it is matched by an ending tag that is the same thing with a / /

<em> tag denotes emphasis on something </em> 

One can add more stuff to the tags inside the < 

<tag attribute = "value" > 

<hr width = "50%" >

The hr tag and other tags like it may not need a closing tag ??


Html pages should always start with the <!tml> tag and end with the  <

<img src="filename" alt="description">
